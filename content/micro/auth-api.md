 Hey, I recently built and deployed an API on AWS using ECS (Elastic Container Service).
 It's currently under development, but you can check out its ~~[documentation](http://auth.rvlz.io/swagger)~~.

 **Update**
 I took down the API, but check out its source code [here](https://github.com/rvlz/auth.rvlz.io).

 Hope you all are doing great!
